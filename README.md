The goal is to build a simple DEX like with functionality similar to UniswapV2
Iteration one will be just a single pair or ERc 20 tokens
To be created with vague knowledge of how UniV2 works

Simple Dex: MSwap

- Add liquidity (deposit) functionality
  - Both tokens must be added at the same time when providing liquidity
  - ERC20 tokens only, no eth pairs
  - No LP tokens for this iteration
- Swap tokens functionality
  - X percent fee taken
  - Fee sent to address set at contract creation
